## Synopsis <a name="Synopsis"></a>

Samson Media Player is a universal media player built in PowerShell that allows you to play and manage all of your local or internet based media within a single app. Import playlists and media from Spotify, YouTube, Twitch and more. 

The screenshot above is from a personalized and custom version made as a fun gift for a friend and his cat Samson, hence the name.

## Project Status <a name="Project_Status"></a>

This app is still under development and undergoing testing to address issues, so expect some rough edges. However, the app is ready for community testing and feedback to help identify remaining issues.

If you wish to help, see **[TESTERS](/TESTERS.MD)** for more information. Testers will get access to special private builds with extra features to make submitting feedback easier.

<a name="Why_PowerShell">**Why PowerShell?**</a>

This project has been both educational and enjoyable, allowing me to explore the capabilities of PowerShell for complex development. The core functionality and a significant portion of the app are built entirely in PowerShell. While using other common languages would be more practical, this showcases PowerShells potential for unconventional yet powerful applications.

* * * 

## Available Versions <a name="Available_Versions"></a>

#### <a name="PrepackagedInstaller">**Prepackaged/Installer**</a>

+ **(NOT YET AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC - SOONâ„¢)** Available builds will be listed under `Releases` or shared directly/privately to QA Testers
+ Prepackaged installer using Inno setup. Will be the primary and recommended version for regular usage
+ **NOTE**: Using the prepackaged installer is not required, but highly recommended. It is used to provide a convenient way to package, deliver and configure.
+ The installer also performs optimizations to improve app performance, such as installing assembles to the GAC and creating native images via [ngen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator)
+ Using the installer also registers Samson as a 'proper' application which provides a few benefits. For example:
	+ GUI windows will appear in the task bar as its own application/icon. Otherwise all windows would just show as PowerShell.
	+ Samson will be listed in Add/Remove programs and can be uninstalled
	+ Taskbar features such as jump-lists are only available with the installed version

#### <a name="PowershellSource_Files">**Powershell/Source Files**</a>

+ PowerShell source files only version, main script to launch is **Samson.ps1**
+ Source code is available via this repository or from installer once run and you choose an install folder
+ Manually download and extract the files to desired location, then execute the main script `Samson.ps1` within the root folder
  + Alternatively, even without using the installed version, you can use `Samson.exe` in the root folder to launch the application
  + `Samson.exe` is just a simple self-executable launcher built in C#. Source code included under `src\launcher` if you wish to build or inspect yourself
  + `Samson.exe` allows the ability to enable some settings such as `Start on Windows Login` which will not work if the exe is missing
* * * 

## Installation and Configuration <a name="Installation_and_Configuration"></a>

### 1. Choose/Download Available Version
  + If using installer, just run through install wizard, choosing location to install. Let it finish but do not launch yet
  + If downloading source files, extract/copy to desired location

### 2. API Setup and Configuration (Optional)<a name="API_Setup_and_Configuration_Optional"></a>

+ Spotify, YouTube and Twitch features require additional setup for their respective API's.
+ See **[API Setup and Configuration](/Resources/Docs/Setup/API_Authentication_Setup.md)** for set-by-step instructions on how to setup your own API accounts for these services, which are free.
+ I really wanted to make this more seamless by including my own development APIs but there is just no way to do that securely

### 3. Run First Time Setup
  + If using installer, run Samson from shortcut created or via `Samson.exe` in the install folder
  + If you downloaded source files, execute `Samson.ps1` in the root folder from PowerShell (non-admin)
  + Upon running for the first time, the First Run Setup/Settings window will appear. Go through and configure as desired
  + Highly recommend reading the help documentation for each setting, by clicking on the **?** icon next to each
  + After finishing setup, the app may restart. If it closes but doesn't restart on its own, wait a minute or so then just relaunch
* * * 

## Uninstalling <a name="Uninstalling"></a>
+ Uninstall is triggered by passing `-Uninstall` to `Samson.exe` or `Samson.ps1`. It is also triggered when uninstalling the package from windows or via the Inno Setup `unins000.exe`
	+ The uninstaller performs the removal of any installed external components (StreamLink, Chocolatey..etc), removes related files (including temp files) and removes any stored secrets from secure vault
	+ The uninstaller will prompt the user to decide if they also wish to remove user related data, such as media profiles, custom playlists, settings..etc
	+ Log files are NOT removed by the uninstaller
