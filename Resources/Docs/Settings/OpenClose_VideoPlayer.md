**When enabled, the video player will automatically be opened anytime media is playing that contains video content. Additionally, when media is stopped or ends, the video player will automatically close**

#####__IMPORTANT__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Media played using the Web Players (which is the default for Spotify and Youtube), may not start until the video player is opened, which this setting will do automatically 
+ This is because the Web Players that play the content don't fully initialize until they are actually shown or become visible
+ Some tricks are used to try and get around this limitation but results vary. Hopefully this can be further improved in the future
+ Enabling this option helps ensure the media will start playing in these scenerios
+ Recommend reviewing the help topics for the **Use Web Player** options (available under Spotify and Youtube) to understand more about the pros and cons of using the Web Players

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% If you decide not to enable this option, just be aware that if media (when using Web Players) do not start playing, you may need to manually open the video player (by pressing the **Video** button)


######__INFO__

 %{color:cyan} ❓% If the video player is undocked as a floating window and/or is fullscreen when media is stopped or ended, it will NOT be automatically docked or closed
