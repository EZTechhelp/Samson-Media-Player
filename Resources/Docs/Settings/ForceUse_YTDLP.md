**Enabling forces the app to always use** [**YT-DLP**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) **to get live streams for Twitch. By default without this enabled, Streamlink is always used**

#####__IMPORTANT__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% While using [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for Twitch streams usually works, expect performance to be much lower, especially the time it takes for the stream to start playing. 

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% You can still enable **Skip Twitch ADs** with this option enabled, but ADs will only be skipped if you are a subscriber to the channel you are watching and have followed the directions under help section of **Skip Twitch ADs**. Otherwise, ADs will likely alway play.

######__INFO__

%{color:cyan} ❓% Streamlink is the recommended (and default) choice due to its extensive support for Twitch, as well as having much better performance. 

%{color:cyan} ❓% This option is only recommended to be used if for some reason Streamlink is no longer working or as a fallback option. 

%{color:cyan} ❓% It should be noted, even without this option enabled, if Streamlink fails when connecting to a stream, [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is automatically tried as a fallback.
