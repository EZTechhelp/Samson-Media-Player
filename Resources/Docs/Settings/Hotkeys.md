**Enables ability to assign global keyboard shorcuts for specific media player controls**

#####__IMPORTANT__

   %{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Registering a hotkey will prevent those keys from working in any other application while this app is running
   
   %{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% In general, hotkeys will work even if this app or any of its windows are not in focus UNLESS another program is capturing/blocking all input, for example:
   + Video games running in exclusive fullscreen mode
   + Fullscreen remote desktop sessions
   
   %{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Registering a hotkey will fail if that hotkey is already registered by another app. Normally this will be apparent when attempting to assign the hotkey, as it wont work
	 
######__INFO__
 
  %{color:cyan} ❓% Currently there are only 3 functions that can be assigned to a hotkey. Other functions likely to be added in future versions. Current functions include:
  + Volume Up
  + Volume Down
  + Mute
  
  %{color:cyan} ❓% This feature should not be confused with System Media controls on keyboard's that have them. Typically those volume controls effect ALL of windows audio. These hotkeys allow effecting ONLY this app.
