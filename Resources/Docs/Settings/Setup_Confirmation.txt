Are you finished configuring settings and wish to continue setup?

NOTE: Choosing yes will start setup and install any required components and then, if needed, the app may restart. 

Media you have configured will begin scanning in the background while the main UI is loaded. Some media will not be available until this is complete. 

You can check each respective media library to see current progress. You may also begin playing any media that is available or set up any custom playlists.
