**Allows selecting the audio output device to be used for playback when not using Web Players. Default selects the current default audio output specified by Windows** 


#####__IMPORTANT__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Changing the output audio device does not apply to any Spotify playback or when using Youtube Web Players, EXCEPT if you have the option `Enable EQ Support for Webplayers` enabled

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% When changing the output to any other device that is not the current windows/system default, the volume output can no longer be controlled using windows audio (via keyboard volume keys or system tray). The volume control within this app can still be used to control volume and mute status.

######__INFO__

 %{color:cyan} ❓% All compatible audio devices found on this system are listed. Changes takes effect immediately on selecting a different device. If any media is currently playing, there may be a momentary pause when output is switched

 %{color:cyan} ❓% The native audio monitor effect (if enabled using the **Monitor** button) will NOT update to reflect the change in device, as it is always tied to the default device specified by windows (at least for now)
