**When enabled, audio output will be muted while Twitch ADs are being skipped. Audio will automatically unmute when Twitch ADs are finished**

#####__IMPORTANT__
%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Given the volatilty of ADs and how AD skipping needs to work, it should go without saying that there is no guarantee it will work everytime. 

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% The same applies to auto-mute and auto-unmute for ADs. There may be times where it doesnt mute, or it mutes but doesnt unmute. This should hopefully be the exception rather than the norm, but just be warned.  

######__INFO__

%{color:cyan} ❓% Typically, if AD skipping is working properly, there likely wont be any audio while they are skipped. However, since the AD skipping itself is not a guarantee, this option makes sure that your not suddenly blasted with Advertisement audio which is typically (and annoyingly) louder than the streams audio.

%{color:cyan} ❓% Additionally, due to how ADs are skipped and how the player handles the stream being 'interrupted' or 'paused', there may often be times where the last few seconds of audio before the AD, starts repeating over and over until the stream resumes. This is the more likely scenerio and why this option was originally added.
