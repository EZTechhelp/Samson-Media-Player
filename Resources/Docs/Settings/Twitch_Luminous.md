**Enabling this attempts to use the Luminous API hosted at eu.luminous.dev to completely block ADs vs just skipping and/or muting them. This proxies the playlist request to a country where Twitch does not serve ads**

#####__IMPORTANT__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% %{color:#FFFFD265} Use at your own risk! Seriously make sure you understand all this FIRST!%

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Due to the volatile and unpredictable nature of blocking Twitch ADs, not to mention differences based on where you live, it cannot be guaranteed that this will work. It may break at any time 

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% This setting has no effect if **Use YTDLP for Twitch Streams** is enabled

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Loading streams may take longer, potentially up to around 10 seconds. (This doesn't affect the latency.)

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Depending on your connection and where you are, there is a greater chance to experience buffering or stuttering

#####__ABOUT LUMINOUS__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Luminous connects to the [Hola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hola_(VPN)) network and gets a Russian proxy to grab playlists, where Twitch Ads arent currently served. Up to you how you feel about that

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% You will not be acting as a peer of the Hola network, it is just used by the hosted instance of Luminious at eu.luminous.dev to grab playlists
 
%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% The actual content and video streams are pulled from EU Twitch servers
