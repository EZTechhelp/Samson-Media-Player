**Enable to use the **[SponsorBlock API](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)** to automatically skip or mute sponsored segments of Youtube videos**

#####__IMPORTANT__

   %{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Currently this option only works when **Use WebPlayer** is enabled under Youtube options. Non-WebPlayer support is still WIP
   
   %{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Its possible that skipping might be off by a second or two, or some segments aren't skipped if available data is not available for the current playing video
	 
######__INFO__
 
  %{color:cyan} ❓% This is currently a very simple implementation of Sponsorblock, so some features such as highlighting sponsored segments and others are not (yet) included. For more information, visit [https://sponsor.ajay.app/](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
