**Enabling performance mode helps reduce both CPU and GPU usage of the app by limiting or disabling various UI effects and animations**

#####__IMPORTANT__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Changes to this setting will take effect on media state change or app restart

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% This setting has no effect on performance related to audio or video playback and decoding. This just applies to the general UI performance

######__INFO__
 %{color:cyan} ❓% When enabled, certain UI animations are disabled or limited such as:

+ The "Loading..." text flashing animation is disabled
+ The sliding text animation within the display panel (and miniplayer display panel) will be reduced to 5 FPS. This can actually look more 'realistic' to how a real digital display would behave
+ The cassette tape wheel rotation animation is disabled
+ The CD rotation animation for the current playing item in the queue is disabled
