**Enables use of Invidious for playback of Youtube media when using the Web Player** 

#####__IMPORTANT__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Requires enabling **'Use Web Player'** Youtube option

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% If a Youtube video fails to play with the normal Youtube Web Player, the app will automatically retry playing the video with Invidious even if this option is turned off

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Using the Invidious Web Player has similiar restrictions as the normal Youtube Web Player such as:

 - EQ and similiar Audio settings. All audio is output through the web player which is a separate process from the main app. 
   
   - Note: You can still use the apps native controls for things like Volume, Mute, Play, Pause or Stop
   

######__INFO__

 %{color:cyan} ❓% Some info about the 'Use Invidious' option and why you might use it:
 
  - Invidious is Open-Source software, which we like
  - May provide better ability to fully embed videos when the Youtube embedded player wont allow it (such as various restricted videos for age, licensiing..etc)
  - Prevents Google from tracking you or what your watching (if that matters to you). Requests are proxied and anonomized through the Invidious server
  - Most if not all videos are AD free
