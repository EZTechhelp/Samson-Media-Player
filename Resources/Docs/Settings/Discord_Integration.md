**Enables Rich Presence integration with the Discord Client allowing the ability to display information about the current playing media**

#####__IMPORTANT__

%{color:#FFFFD265} ❗% Due to a (really stupid) limitation of the Discord SDK, its currently not possibly to display the activity type as anything other than 'Playing a Game' despite an app like Spotify being able to use the Listening type

######__INFO__

%{color:cyan} ❓%  When playing any media it will display info such as: 
 + Source of Media (Youtube,Spotify..etc)
 + Media Title
 + Media Artist
 + Current duration


%{color:cyan}❓% Youtube, Spotify and Twitch media will also show a clickable 'Label', such as 'Listen on Spotify' or 'Watch on Youtube'..etc. Clicking this will open the related web URL for that media
